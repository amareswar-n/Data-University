Python is easy!

You can learn enough Python in <8 hours to pick the rest up with active practice.

Here are my top 5 free places to catch the basics:

*1. Codeacademy (where I first learnt Python) -
https://lnkd.in/eZnqKD_x

*2 MITx 6.0001 (this series is a brilliant intro to CS) -
https://lnkd.in/eeBXsQqr

3/ Think Python (has great exercises) -
https://lnkd.in/eWN9sff8

4/ Automate the Boring Stuff (use what you learn!) -
https://lnkd.in/e-UnwRj3

5/ Python 4 Everybody (really well put together course)
https://www.py4e.com/

These are all solid resources.

You'll pick up enough to start making sense of things and be able to Google the rest as you learn.

And after a short while, you'll start to see where it gets tough and what the difficult parts of mastering the language are.

But that's a post for another day.
